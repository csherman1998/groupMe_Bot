# groupMe_scraper
Not so much a groupMe Scraper as it is a bot

this code is absolute shit, but to be fair I literally know zero python and i've made 100% of this project secretely 
while at work using putty and vim, which I'm also shit at. 

The func file is really unoptimized and theres a few errors that need to be accounted for


If you want to copy this for your own groupMe bot, you can, just make sure you
define api_key as a local environment variable and probably nohup the script
on a VPS or something
